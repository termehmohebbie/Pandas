# Summary of Analysis
This data is desribing 15 schools with 39170 students, containing details about the score of students in math and reading class.
In this challenge we categorized schools by different metrics such as their type, size and budget and evaluate scores of students for math, reading, overall,and the passing percentage to analyze the performance of each school.
One interesting insight which is obtained by looking at the overall passing percentage, is that all of the top performing schools are Charter schools, also smaller schools with a total budget around 1 mollion dollars, and all of the worst-performing schools are District, larger and also with a budget almost doubled!!
If we take a closer look to average scores by grade level table, we can understand that there's not much of a noticable difference between different grade levels of each school and the tolerance is mainly around 1%.
The table with spending ranges demonstrates that the relation between budget for each student and overall passing percentage is inverse, meaning the higher the budget is, the lower the performance and the average scores are.
We can also see that when the school size is larger than 2000 students the overall prformance, average scores and number of passing students has a considerable decrease.
Finally, comparing schools only by their type, we can understand that average math score and number of student that passed the math class are much lower in district schools than charter schools, this difference in reading score averages is less but still charter schools have a better overall performance.
